## 2D to 3D - 3D to BIM

This project aims to create a 3D ifc model from a 2D floor plan usin AI. The user should be able to upload a floorplan where openCv code will try and find all the floors, the user should then be able to press on any floors the AI model missed.

Then it should create a JSON file containing necessary data to build it in Bim viewer/clay made by That open Company.

In this viewer, user should be able to do certain actions on the building like: Delete walls, move walls, create new walls...

In the end, it should be possible to export as an ifc with all changes saved.

The code utilizes the openbim_clay repository made by ThatOpenCompany, to display walls.
